<p> Grouped feedback delay networks are an efficient means of modeling coupled room acoustics in real-time. They combine multiple feedback delay networks in parallel with a coupled mixing matrix (Das et al.). In this work, we extend the design of coupled mixing matrices to include FIR filters and propose theorems to maintain stability and losslessness of the network (Schlecht et al.). We use these theorems to model diffraction at the aperture connecting multiple rooms. Synthesized room impulse responses are available <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~orchi/FDN/GFDN/Frequency-dependent/GFDN-FFM.html">here</a>. A JUCE plugin is available <a href = "https://github.com/orchidas/GFDN">here</a>. </p>
